Getting Started
=====

TTools is a clean and straightforward library for dealing with the Twitter API.

##Requirements
TTools only requires the php5-curl extension.

##Installing

Installation can be easily made through composer. Add [ttools/ttools](https://packagist.org/packages/ttools/ttools) to your composer.json:

    {
        "require": {
            "ttools/ttools": "2.1.0"
        }
    }


After running composer install/update you will be able to use TTools in your application.


##Creating your first application

The easiest way to play around with the Twitter API is creating a single-user application. This means you will not need to authenticate users, as you will be working with fixed user tokens.


The code below shows the user (the owner of the provided tokens) timeline:

    <?php
    require( __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php');
    
    $config = array(
        'consumer_key'        => 'APP_CONSUMER_KEY',
        'consumer_secret'     => 'APP_CONSUMER_SECRET',
        'access_token'        => 'USER_TOKEN',
        'access_token_secret' => 'USER_TOKEN_SECRET',
    );
    
    $app = new \TTools\App($config);
    $timeline = $app->getTimeline();
    print_r($timeline);
    
For this example to work, you need to have the 4 keys necessary to authenticate requests. 
To get your keys, you need to first register your application at http://dev.twitter.com . On the application details page, there's an option to generate your access tokens; 
use them along with the application tokens (``consumer_key`` and ``consumer_secret``) in the config array (as shown in the example above) and you will have a ready-to-request Twitter App.
